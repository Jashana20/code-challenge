1. Any style guides you used for your coding:

4. Description of how the application works:
-I've split all of my components into 2 main types: 
    container components (handling the logic and all information that'll be interated through)
    presentational components (simply displaying information in a certain way, done for each instance of the iteration) (children of container components)

5. If you ran out of time what else you would have done:
-I would have done alot more with the styling (centered the card on the page, changed the colours/fonts etc. - also made the cards and images the same size for every country)
- DRY - refactored my code and made it less repetitive in some places
